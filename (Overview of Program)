# How does the ifswitch section works? -- A programmers overview

First press Alt + Shift + 1.

This will call the function switch_section_hotkey_number(Number, IFSHIFT).

## switch_section_hotkey_number
- It will first call the Stored__home_section_pos.
- Then It will multiply the Number_input by 10, because we added shift to our input. 
- It will then set the global stored home position.
- Then it will display the current section as a tooltip.

- The two points above call `Switch_Section_by_category`.

Switch_Section_by_category(Letter_Input, Number_input, Minecraft_Window_Title)

The Number_input is passed onto the the function.

Here's where stuff gets complicated.

## Switch_Section_by_category

- First it reads HomeStorage.ini, by calling Parse_Sections_Homes_Into_Array().

- Then it recursively finds the Number_input you gave it, by checking the array. 

- Once it finds the meta section (order of appearance), by using the Number_input to find the sub section input; it can now return the meta section.

- Time to review Parse_Sections_Homes_Into_Array()

## Parse_Sections_Homes_Into_Array
- Defines The home_section multidimensional array. 

- It puts all sections separated by enter, into the 0th meta index, seperated by sub indexes. 
  ```ahk
  home_sections[0][1] = First section

  home_sections[0][2] = Second section

  etc
  ```

- It then gets the total sum of the sections in HomeStorage. This is used to know how much to loop.

- It then defines the subsection values.

- Returns the subsection values.

### It now has all it needs to determine what to set the `Stored__home_section_pos`.

- Once that is set, the `Stored__home_section_pos` is used later, when you need to teleport to a home.
