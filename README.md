- Please keep the files in a folder, since Script will be working off it's current directory 


1. Launch Script once. This will create your config file. 
2. Open your .ini file. 
3. add a space after the home, and input your home.

```
Before:
Home1=home
Home2=home
Home3=home
...
After:
Home1=home h
Home2=warp spawn
Home3=home spider_xp_farm
...
```
- You don't need it to be a home. 
This script types whatever you have in your config corelating to the button you pressed after alt, after inputting /
